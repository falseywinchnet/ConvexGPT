# ConvexGPT
Mostly Convex ICNN based Large Language Model - Commercial Code - this repository is for sale - you have 400 billion. pay me.

“If you are a student interested in building the next generation of AI systems, don’t work on LLMs. This is in the hands of large companies, there’s nothing you can bring to the table. You should work on next-gen AI systems that lift the limitations of LLMs.” Yann Lecun.. please retire. you are ugly and also stupid and also you work for a reptilian so there is that

* 1: structural guarantees let Fenchel‐decode 2 step or less, vs gpt at 10-15 steps. cheaper 
* 2: cleanly vectorizable, cache capabilities implementable. scales the same as GPT in cost.
* 3: vastly Lower-precision friendly and higher robustness to adversarial or out-of-distribution input
* 4: no sequential bottlenecks from scaling
* 5: Lipschitz is tight, jacobian positive semidefinite, all information lives on hyperplanes
* 6: did i mention it was made in america?
